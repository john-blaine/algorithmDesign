Algorithm design with ToyProblems

My solutions for toy problem algorithms written in Javascript for the Browser.

Requirements

This suite requires node.

Installation

Either fork this repo, or just download the latest release directly. Open a terminal window, and cd into the toyproblems directory. Run: yarn install or npm install Duplicate the _template directory and rename to whatever your first problem is. Write your tests in the spec.js file. Write (or copy and paste) your algorithm in the src.js file. Run SpecRunner.html Enjoy some TDD!! :)

Contributing

This repo is a showcase for my own solutions to these problems. However, you are welcome to fork/clone this repo, delete my code, and use this testing system for yourself. While I have many other toy problems that simply aren't listed here yet, if you have one that you don't see, I'd love to hear about it!
